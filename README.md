RayTracer
=========

A simple raytracer made from scratch for a school assignment back in 2009.  The program is currently only able to render a 640x480 image showing three colored balls, one glass ball, and a few colored planes.  Some effects rendered are reflections, refractions, soft shadows, and depth-of-field (motion-blur is available, but must be enabled through code).

The source is compatible with both Linux and Windows.

Plans for the future:

*  ~~Get working in Linux~~
*  Add ability to change objects rendered, image size, render quality, etc. without having to change the code
*  Show the image being rendered in real-time
*  Rendering optimizations, such as multi-threading and spacial boundaries
*  Texturing
*  Load models

Special thanks to Craig Grupp, who worked with me at the time on the assignment and implemented motion blur and depth-of-field.
